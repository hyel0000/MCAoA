This repository is an implementation of the paper "An Improved Attention for Visual Question Answering", which introduces new attention modules—SAoA (Self Attention on Attention) and GAoA (Guided Attention on Attention)—and a novel multi-modal attention fusion method. The project builds upon Yuhao Cui's implementation of MCAN (Modular Co-Attention Network).
